# Fat16

Fat16 filesystem reader library written in C. 

This is very much a WIP project with missing features and bugs. It will even try to read fat12 filesystems, but will fail miserably.

## Usage
An example usage can be found in [main.c](main.c). It shows how to open and close volumes, directories and files.
